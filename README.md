Point of light effects with an Adadfruit NeoPixel matrix

This Arduino library uses an Adafruit NeoPixel matrix to create animated special effects for points of light. These "particles" can be used singlely or in a group to create animations, including fireworks, fairies (i.e. "Tinker Bell"), fireflies, and fire. 

Animations are built using individual effects. These individual effects can be used together to easily make complex animations.

Documentation is still under development. Look for sketches in the examples folder for code examples.

More animation examples and project development can be found on the author's twitter account @cogliano.
